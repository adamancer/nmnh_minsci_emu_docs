For some records, the primary object is itself a prepation, like vial of powder or box of thin sections. In this case, the specimen count is the number of preparations.

ecatalogue,Meteorites,Meteorite Details,Meteorite Name,- MetMeteoriteName,The official name of the meteorite,Required,"For **non-Antarctic meteorites**, the name should exactly match the Name field for the corresponding MBDB record. Most meteorites are named after the nearest named place to where they fell, so these names are usually simple strings.

For **Antarctic meteorites**, the name must be the meteorite number as currently asssigned by NASA. The NASA meteorite number consists of two components: a generic identifier identifying a mass and an optional specific identifier (often referred to as a comma number) identifying a subsample. The generic identifier includes:

- A three-character alphabetic prefix identifying the general area where the meteorite was collected
- A space
- A five- to six-digit number (YYDDD or YYDDDD, where YY is the last two digits of the collection year and DDD/DDDD is the number identifying a mass)

If a specific identfier has been assigned, append a comma followed by that identifier to the generic identifier. A representative example is ""ALH 83101,15"", where ""ALH 83101"" is the generic identifier and ""15"" is the specific identifier.

Some notes on meteorite numbers:

- Meteorites collected early on in ANSMET used a letter to separate the locality prefix from the specimen number. The letter was intended to signify different field seasons within a year. Those additional field seasons never materialized, but some meteorites from the early years of the program were originally numbered named using an ""A"" instead of a space. MBDB retains the original identifiers, but NASA's public documentation has standardized all meteorites numbers to use a space. In other words, ""ALHA76001"" in MBDB is the same as ""ALH 76001"" in NASA's documentation. We use the NASA identifiers but retain the original numbers in the Other Numbers grid.
- MBDB includes the NASA meteorite number in the Abbrev. field. MBDB uses the Name field to provide the full name of the collection area. For example, for ALH 83101, MBDB uses ""Allan Hills 83101"" for the name ""ALH 83101"" for the abbreviation.

Names are aligned with MBDB annually. Roughly 100 meteorites in the collection could not be matched to an entry in MBDB.

(2015), the Meteorite Nomenclature Committee revised fall categorization for recent meteorite discoveries to better capture that uncertainty. The terms they settled on are included in the Allowed Values list. We plan implement that vocabulary but, as of 2022, none of the meteorites in the collection has been assigned to one of the new categories.

The boundaries of the Arctic and Southern Oceans seem to vary seasonally. The Southern Ocean is not part of the official IHO ocean list but has been added to the IHO shapefile on the Marine Regions website.

The generic Atlantic and Pacific Ocean names should be avoided when possible. Map them to either North or South if coordinates or other locality info allows. The north/south divisions generally follow the equator, with the exception of the Galapagos and Gilbert Islands, which cross the equator but are assigned to the South Pacific Ocean. Other features that cross the equator but are not addressed by IHO include:

ecollectionevents,Exp/Method,Expedition Details,Cruise Number,- AquCruiseNumber,"The identifier assigned by the organization that operates a vessel to a research cruise, that is, a continuous, port-to-port voyage conducted to make observations or collect specimens. The terms ""cruise"" and ""leg"" are interchangeable for the purposes of this field.
",Omit if no appropriate data is available,"Typically, the identifier is either a number or an alphanumeric code. Cruise number formats vary widely between or even within organizations, with different abbreviations, delimiters, or zero-padding conventions being used in different documents. There are no hard rules for formatting a cruise number, but a good practice is to search for a vessel name to see how cruise numbers for that vessel have been recorded previously.

Cruise numbers should include the leg if known, and legs should not be recorded elsewhere (for example, in notes). Many organizations already incorporate the leg into their cruise identifiers, but if not, it is acceptable to append the leg to the cruise number. For example, leg 2 of cruise ABCD can be entered as ""ABCD-2"".

It accepts a variety of formats in addition to the display formats above, including but not limited to:
- January 1, 1970
- Jan 1, 1970
- 1970-01-01
- 1970-01
- 0101970

Use the most specific date format possible.

If only a single date is available, include that date in both the start and completion date fields. For example, if a cruise took place in Jan 1970 but the exact start and end dates are not known, enter ""Jan 1970"" in both fields. If a cruise took place in 1970 and the exact dates are not known, enter ""1970"" in both fields.
