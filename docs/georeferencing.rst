Meteorites collected by the Antarctic Search for Meteorites Program
*******************************************************************

Coordinates for meteorites collected by the Antarctic Search for
Meteorites (ANSMET) program are taken from NASA's `Complete Listing of
Antarctic Meteorites in the U.S. Collection
<https://curator.jsc.nasa.gov/antmet/excel/usantmet.xls>`_. NASA
describes their coordinate data as follows:

    Position data has been derived from a variety of surveying
    techniques (primarily GPS since the early 1990's) used by ANSMET
    field teams and reflects a typical uncertainty of around 10 m. The
    data has been truncated to avoid confusing high precision (many
    decimal places) with high accuracy (low error). These positions
    reflect a realistic “best available” accuracy, at ˜50x higher
    resolution than required by federal regulations.

All meteorites collected by ANSMET are assigned source=ANSMET, radius=10
m, and a determination date marking the year of collection. Meteorites
collected before 1993 are assigned method=Surveying and datum=Unknown.
Meteorites collected during or after 1993 are assigned method=GPS and
datum=WGS 84.
